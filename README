A sample Tokenizer built using Perl and its built-in function - split().

I have create the sample inuput file - perl.

Its basically an ASCII form of the Wikipedia page which talks about perl : 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl

I have applied tokenization to this file and have redirected the output to 
output_token.txt 

I have also attached the output_token.txt for reference.
