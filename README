1. code_check.pl

This Perl program performs a check of 'C Programs'. Here I have written a code that checks for an assignment
statement made by mistake inside an if statement.
example
if (x = y) {

}

is an erroneous if statement.

Such a statement is then redirected to the output_codecheck file. You could check that file to see how the 
erroneous if statement is identified and outputted.

2. token.pl
This Perl program is a sample Tokenizer built using Perl's built-in function - split().

I have create the sample inuput file - Perl.

Its basically an ASCII form of the Wikipedia page which talks about perl : 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl

I have applied tokenization to this file and have redirected the output to 
output_token.txt 

I have also attached the output_*.txt for reference.

Have included different methods to perform parsing on the text file.


3. parsewords.pl
This Perl program is a better way of performing tokenization based on whitespaces. 
I have used the library and the shellwords () function to do whitespacing tokenization.

4. datastructures.pl
This Perl program includes a simple implementation of the Stack Data structure using Perl.

5. http.pl
This Perl program connects to the specified URL and the response header is stored in a string along with 
the html content
